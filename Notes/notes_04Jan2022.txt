in examination, some portion of the code is already given.
mostly, all imports are done already
But it is better to be aware of the imports to be done for any class/interface

every problem statement at the last mention the time allowed	10 seconds

reverse order
	ListIterator
		moved to last
		empty for loop
		previous

	move using index
	size()-1


------------------------------------------------------------
Date and Time API 
----------------------------
an user enters the date as a String input

How we can represent it in variable?
disadvantages of keeping a date in a String variable:
	it will allow 31-Feb-2023
	
there are some valid date literals
	2023-02-01	most commonly used format		HTML5 <input type="date" /> gives you 
			mysql

	01-Feb-23

	08-09-2000		no clarity		

While asking input, can we guide the user to enter in a particular format:
	Enter your Date of Birth(dd/MM/yyyy):

or we can provide date picker		<input type="date" />

java.util.Date		Date class

Date dt1=new Date();		the constructor of Date class fills current system date

How to convert a String into Date?

Date.parse(str);		//	yyyy/MM/dd

long result = Date.parse("2023/08/01");
		Date dt=new Date(result);
		System.out.println(dt);

suppose, if user enters date in other formats?		not any format.
how can we convert that string into date?

To simply convert String to Date and vice versa,
we can use
	SimpleDateFormat
		parse		converts String to Date
		format		converts Date to String

Learn the symbols used in date format
d		1 digit day		if you use only "d"		it will show 1 as 1 and 12 is shown as 12 only
dd		2 digit day		1 is shown as 01
MM		2 digit month
MMM		3 letter month		Feb		Mar
MMMM		full month		February
yy
yyyy
EEEE		EEE		Mon	Tue
		EEEE		full week day
mm		minutes
AM		AM / PM 		based on value

Task:
	Identify as many symbols in Date Format



Every date is a millisecond started from 1970 Jan 1st and ticks every milliseconds

1) Find the age based on date of birth and current date
2) Find the number of months between 2 dates
3) Find if an year is leap year or not
4) Find when is the next friday coming
5) Find the policy maturity date
	start date + number of years


1) Find the age based on date of birth and current date

	
Accept a String input from the user (date of birth)
convert it into Date 

based on today's date, find the age and display in 
	You are 10 years, 8 months, 7 days old



class Date
{
	day
	month
	year

}

java version upto 1.4
there was no LocalDate

	LocalDate

Period.between(ld1, ld2)

class Period
{
	days
	months

}

2016	is not divisible by 400	but leap year


		GregorianCalendar gc=new GregorianCalendar();		
		System.out.println(gc.isLeapYear(2004));
